## Contributing

1. [Fork][fork] the [official repository][repo].
2. [Create a topic branch.][branch]
3. Implement your feature or bug fix.
4. Test your change on iOS and Android (and on multiple devices/screen sizes, if
   applicable)
5. Add, commit, and push your changes.
6. [Submit a pull request.][pr]

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not
accept, pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business
day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted,

* Explain in the PR description why the change is important or necessary
* For new features, discuss the idea with us first by [creating an issue]
* Include screenshots if there are visual changes. For bonus points, include a
  markdown table showing before/after screenshots for different devices (See
  https://github.com/thoughtbot/PurpleTrainElm/pull/60 for an example)
* Follow the existing style of the project
